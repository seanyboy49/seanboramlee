# Sean Lee's Personal Website

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio website that contains samples and links to a selection of my development, design and filmmaking work. It is a React app based of the wonderful [SPA boilerplate](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) by [Rafael Pedicini](https://github.com/rafrex). 

Unless otherwise noted, all illustrations were done by me.

## Planned Features

1) Building a custom video player to host all my film examples
2) SVG animations for each of the slider photos.
